            <h4>2.Marmala Waterfalls</h4>
            Falling from 60 meters, the cascading Marmala waterfalls is a feast for the eyes when it merges with Meenachail River.

            <h4>3.Elaveezhapoonchira</h4>
            Elaveezhapoonchira is a hill station in Kottayam, and the perfect weekend getaway for people coming in from Kochi and Trivandrum. Elaveezha means “leaves that do not fall” and poonchira means “valley”, so basically it is a valley where the leaves do not fall.
