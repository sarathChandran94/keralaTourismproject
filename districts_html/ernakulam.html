        <h2>ERNAKULAM</h2>

        <P>Ernakulam is a sprawling metropolis that beautifully combines its natural wonders with providing a base for a majority of the State’s business enterprises. Flanked by the Arabian sea, it is easily among the most visited locations in Kerala. It is an extremely important commercial centre but also has a plethora of destinations for tourists to enjoy.
        <P>The city of Kochi, with its fine natural harbour, is the undisputed crown jewel of the district. From historic locations that transport you to a time when it acted as the commercial hub of the legendary Spice Route to exotic trips on boats where one can simply relax and soak in the weather, Kochi never disappoints. Ernakulam has always epitomized the Malayali spirit of welcoming all who visit it and this tradition continues to this day.</P>

One can spot remnants of Portuguese and Dutch colonialism in this quaint city which is dotted with similar structures and has an overall ambience that brings to light the colonial powers that once ruled over the place. The fort region of Kochi has witnessed the rise and fall of great powers including the Portuguese, Chinese and the Dutch, before it came under the nation-wide British rule in the 18th century. Fort Kochi is lined with old European structures, churches and other architectural buildings which transport you back to a different era.

            <h4>3.Jewish Synagogue</h4>
            Amongst the 7 synagogues located in this region, this Jewish synagogue is the only one which is in operation today. It was constructed in 1568 and is also called the Cochin Jewish Synagogue or Mattencherry Synagogue. A journey inside takes you through the rich architecture and history of the place and the pulpit in the middle of the hall signifies the rich heritage of a not so long ago established prayer centre. The building’s interior has been done up with rare and handcrafted materials most if which are extinct today. The best part is that the synagogue is still run by Jews and not the government authorities, which has helped to a great extent in maintaining the authenticity of the holy place.
