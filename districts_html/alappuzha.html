        <h2>ALAPPUZHA</h2>

        <p>With the deep Arabian Sea lining its coast, Alappuzha nestles in the lap of nature, as an intricate grid of canals, lagoons, and waterways weaves through its landscape. Untouched by the snares of hectic urban routines, this timeless city has a rustic feel to it. From the rhythmic rowing of the chundan boats in the backwaters to the lush green stretches of paddy fields, each of its features casts a charming spell on travelers. The colorful and diverse culture, enriched by centuries of historical influences, only adds to its mystic allure.</p>
        <p>Alappuzha, popularly known as Alleppey, is among Kerala’s historically phenomenal cities. Changing hands from the colonial powers of Portuguese and Dutch during 16th and 17th centuries, the city was eventually conquered by Marathanda Varma. The roots of the Syrian Catholic church can be traced in the city. Its vibrant culture and mesmerizing landscape have earned it the title of ‘Venice of the East'</p>

          <h4>1.Backwaters of Kuttanad</h4>
          When you go along the backwaters of Kuttanad, you will get a chance to glimpse the bucolic way of life of the people and marvel at the exotic aquatic and avian life. The entire length of Kuttanad stretches for a distance of approximately 150 kilometres right from Kollam to Kochi and can be enjoyed through rice barges or houseboats. The house boat ride from Kollam to Alappuzha is a divine experience, but must be pre-booked if you want to enjoy it to its full advantage. You can make it a full-day tour or an overnight one if you want to savour a beautiful night under the stars
