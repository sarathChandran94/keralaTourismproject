Situated at the foot of the Western Ghats , this is the gateway to Kerala from the north.Palakkad derives its name from the Malayalam words Pala ( Alsteria scholaris) and Kadu (forest) which goes to prove that this place was once a beautiful stretch of forests covered with the sweet scented flowers of the Pala tree.</p>
